##Description
This project created a bio page for my web development work to share with potential employers.  Main goals of the bio were to include RWD and functioning links to projects, as well as directing the user to correct locations within the webpage from the navigation bar. This is currently a working bio, because I am new to the web development world.  New links to work will be added as I build my portfolio.
